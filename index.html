            No, really. Your input is needed. We, as a society, are in the midst of a radical shift in the way we produce goods,
            with new, high-tech manufacturing tools and the free exchange of ideas and mass collaboration across the internet,
            and itâ€™s driven by folks just like you. Your Input Needed is a feature-length documentary exploring the huge changes
            on the horizon, and we need your help.

                    <p>
                        The internet brought us an information and communication revolution where the global community can share
                        ideas and messages but only very recently has the rapid, open and collaborative nature of the internet
                        translated into shaping the physical world. With rapid micro manufacturing technology and open and
                        decentralized organizing tactics, community landscapes, product markets and nearly every aspect of our
                        lives are being transformed. With this model we've seen neighborhoods beautified, youth empowered and
                        innovations brought to fruition more rapidly, but we've also seen economic interests threatened and concerns
                        with public safety arise.

                    <p>
                        This feature length documentary is an open source, collaborative project where your input will shape who we
                        interview, what projects we follow, and even what footage makes it into the final cut. We're currently in
                        pre-production which means we're researching and scheduling interviews with hackers, makers, movers and
                        shakers. Do you know of somebody making radical changes in an open and collaborative way? Do you know about
                        a project that isn't asking permission to innovate publicly? Let us know!
